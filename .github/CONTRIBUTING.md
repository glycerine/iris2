# How to contribute

Iris2 loves to welcome your contributions. There are several ways to help out:

* Create an [issue](https://github.com/go-iris2/iris2/issues) on GitHub, if you have found a bug
* Write test cases for open bug issues
* Write patches for open bug/feature issues, preferably with test cases included

We try to respond and act very quick to increase productivity with Iris2
